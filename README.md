# Simple Weather Web App

**Welcome to our Simple Weather Web App!**

## Overview

Our Simple Weather Web App is a straightforward tool that provides you with current weather information for your desired location. No frills, no fuss, just quick weather updates.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- An internet connection.

### Usage

1. Visit [Weather App](https://ernest-lamptey.github.io/weather_app/).
2. Type in the name of the location you want the weather for.
3. Click the "Get Weather" button.
4. You'll instantly see the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a descriptive icon.

### Customization

Feel free to make the web page your own:

- **index.html**: Customize the layout.
- **style.css**: Adjust the styles and look.
- **main.js**: Tweak the functionality or add new features.

## Improvements
- Build this application again with a frontend library to enhance the security
- Animate styling to respond to the weather description
- Improve the overall design and user experience
- Run the search when the user hits "Enter" on keyboard
- Use HTML5 Geolocation API to get weather info. This feature however requires that the page runs on https and the workaround I found requires the creation of a self signed certificate which is a bit of a long setup. I will work on it.
